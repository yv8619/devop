Network

IP address - unique address of any device connected to  a network.

IPV4/IPV6 - For generating unique ip address ipv4/ipv6 standards is followed. 

0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255 . 0-255 

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in length. 

- - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - 
2^7	     2^0


Subnet - dividing network to public n private based on IP range. Subnet can be divided into 2 - public subnet, private subnet. 
private subnet do not have access to internet while public subnet have access to internet. 

If for a subnet we need only 256 IP addresses , then the CIDR would be 172.0.0.0/24  i.e keep first 24 bits common and only last 8 dynamic.

172.0.0.0/8	class A 	256*256*256		
172.5.0.0/16	class B	256*256			65000 ip address
172.5.3.0/24	class C	256				256 ip address

private IP will always start with 192, 172, 10.


OSI model : 7 layers (Open Systems Interconnection)

even before request is initiated , say to google from our browser 2 things are sorted first
- DNS resolution
- TCP handshake

https://www.google.com  -> DNS will map its corresponding IP in ISP. All ISP will maintain a DNS mapping.

TCP -  3 way
TCP creates a connection between your computer and server even before sending data. Called sync.
Once connection is ready, request is sent to server. Once request recieved server acknowledges the request.
Server responds to the request , client also acknowledges the same.

Source to server (L7 to L1)
Layer 7 - browser resolves request protocol, headers etc. Application layer
Layer 6 - browser do data encryption. Presentation layer
Layer 5 - browser session is created. Session layer.
Layer 4 - data segmentation takes place. also protocol is resolved TCP/UDP. Transport layer
Layer 3 - how to transfer data. Network layer
Layer 2 - handles the framing, addressing, and error detection of data transmitted between devices on the same local network. Data link layer.
Layer 1 - Physical Layer is the lowest layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the actual physical transmission of raw binary data over a physical medium, such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.

Server to source ( L1 to L7)
