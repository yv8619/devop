what is a server ?
a server is a computer or a system that provides services to other computers, known as clients, in a network. These servers can be of different memory size.
All servers are computers, but not all computers are servers. 


what is a hypervisor ?
The hypervisor is like a shared house which divide the house into separate rooms and let different families live in each room. 
each room acts like a VM (a virtual computer) havings its own resources ( like kitchen, bathroom ). hypervisor helps in running multiple OS on same computer.
so when we request a VM(ec2) on AWS, this VM is created on one of the physical server in a data center in a region like mumbai with the help of hypervisor.


VM - means hiring a rental computer of your choice of any OS, RAM, Size. This can be installed on your computer or having it on cloud like AWS, Azure.
User --> aws console --> EC2 --> ip address


how to automate creating ec2 creation ?
user --> aws cli (python script) --> aws api --> ec2 creation
or
user --> aws cloud formation template --> ec2 creation
or
user --> aws cloud development kit (CDK) 
or
Terraform ( resource creation tool ) - support resource creation in any cloud.


what are the cli used for OS and windows ?
OS - iTerm2
windows - Putty, Mobaxterm, NoMachine.


How to connect to ec2 instance from terminal ?
ssh -i .pemlocation ubuntu@publicIP  ( -i means identify file)
chmod 600 .pemlocation
ssh -i .pemlocation ubuntu@publicIP


AWS Cli - is a binary. we need to download in our system. 
To provide credentials to cli, aws profile -> secrity credentials -> create access key .
aws cli -> aws configure -> enter key n password ->
